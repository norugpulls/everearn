# EverEarn
The Everearn team David Rahman and Trent Butler (names probably fake) **rugpulled** BabyCardano and CardanoEvo v1. They claim they were only moderators for Cardanoevo v2, but this has proven to be a lie. Here is the **proof** that links the Everearn Creator wallet to the wallet that rugpulled BabyCardano and CardanoEvo v1.

## Tokens:

BabyCardano (bADA):  [Contract Address 0x154697e2d1362796fD778044030079d8c184e0F8 | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x154697e2d1362796fD778044030079d8c184e0F8)  
CardanoEvo v1 (cEvo):  [Contract Address 0x7a18B98765f24A85f7966773A48A1D59d7Ac51e2 | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x7a18B98765f24A85f7966773A48A1D59d7Ac51e2)   
Everearn (EARN):  [Contract Address 0x47d42E0e864ceFf8C4270F7b6E1f6F91Da45882C | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x47d42E0e864ceFf8C4270F7b6E1f6F91Da45882C) 

## Wallets:

Rugpull wallet:  [Address 0x14cd90E5D730421E6B22640bB4A4124b92EFF016 | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x14cd90E5D730421E6B22640bB4A4124b92EFF016)  (RP)  
Contract creator of Everearn:  [Address 0x6fBfEa4fBc422e5BbBb9c625Ba1f0e8d26DcFD35 | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x6fBfEa4fBc422e5BbBb9c625Ba1f0e8d26DcFD35)  (EC)  
Aggregator wallet:  [Address 0xFCe54465ad5F95A3379BA37F67Ab25E818996e47 | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0xFCe54465ad5F95A3379BA37F67Ab25E818996e47)  (A)  
BSC Output wallet:  [Address 0x32cc24538304733F0f6f87a74d96FC30F9838EeE | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x32cc24538304733F0f6f87a74d96FC30F9838EeE)  (O)  
Marketing wallet of Everearn: [Address 0xc556c701a8b638256f024072a314d21496c945d0 | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0xc556c701a8b638256f024072a314d21496c945d0) (M)  

## Transactions:

Remove Liquidity CardanoEvo v1:  [Binance Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x55285f5e84ba5c3fdccb3455e01670370235811509e13481f9403d3f189e0ea2)  from wallet (RP)  
Remove Liquidity BabyCardano:  [Binance Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xd9eb023c2cde7dc929a95934a154c936a940b072ebbb76ab9d616cc78d24a8c5)  from wallet (RP)  
BNB Transfer links (RP) and (A) wallet:  [Binance Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x2fb2b7861525021af52527747ea6d420b37738a58eccae91ac35bead98d96204)   
BNB Transfer links (EC) and (A) wallet:  [Binance Transaction Hash (Txhash) Details | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/tx/0xef943ce652c091acbb5a252764a23432cdb746784b4ccb0291c5da85b1998606) 


So both Rugpull wallet (RP) and Everearn Creator wallet (EC) transfer high amounts of BNB to the same Aggregator wallet (A), which already transferred more than 580 BNB through the Output wallet (O) to a BSC Hub.  
Note, there are more transactions that link the Rugpull wallet and the Everearn Creator wallet (EC).

## Why did the token address change between the first canceled presale and the second finalized presale?

1st presale KYC'd and audited: [Contract Address 0x3bf0606Dd9A15A76C8A76B3e19fC928301c8C5bE | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x3bf0606Dd9A15A76C8A76B3e19fC928301c8C5bE)  
2nd presale **not** KYC'd nor audited: [Contract Address 0x47d42E0e864ceFf8C4270F7b6E1f6F91Da45882C | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x47d42E0e864ceFf8C4270F7b6E1f6F91Da45882C)

If you look at bscscan the source code of the two contracts are **identical** and they've now got the second live contract reaudited. So why go through all this hassle instead of just using the existing contract?  
**Because the 2nd one is now no longer KYC'd with pinksale.** Which means they can do anything with this contract and pinksale can not reveal their identities.

## What makes this scam so sophisticated?

The team establishes a lot of trust with the community, there are daily AMAs and David Rahman was even live on video on one of those. Further they really planned this whole thing through, creating a fake chat explaining their involvement in CardanoEvo with a fully believable backstory. 

## What other proof is there?

Besides the transactions linking the Everearn Contract Creator to the Rugpull wallet of CardanoEvo and BabyCardano, the team has at some points in the AMAs contradicted themselves concerning the backstory of CardanoEvo.   
In the AMA from Feb 15th 2022  [CardanoEvo Evolution Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BE0c29wshg&t=18m5s "CardanoEvo Evolution Explained 2/15/22") David Rahman claims, and it also reflects in the chat he showed, that he volunteered for BabyCardano (bADA). However, in the AMA from Feb 26th 2022 he denies being involved in CardanoEvo v1 and BabyCardano and only joined the team for CardanoEvo v2.

## Ok so they rugpulled these two, but how does the Everearn scam work?

As of now Everearn has not been rugpulled, but they are continuously draining the Marketing wallet (M) that receives 2% BNB of every transaction. Here are some of the drain wallets (there are a lot), no surprise the Aggregator wallet (A) is one of those, so even more connection to the rugpulls of CardanoEvo and BabyCardano:

Main Drain wallet: [Address 0xf3514bd18ff9c23ec22c2904eb6111742fcb6d47 | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0xf3514bd18ff9c23ec22c2904eb6111742fcb6d47) (MD)  
Another Drain wallet: [Address 0x29a1ad005df47b38b059b67e00e40903fc0a55be | BscScan](https://bscscan.com/address/0x29a1ad005df47b38b059b67e00e40903fc0a55be) (AD)

(just a few as an example, there are a lot more, check the Marketing wallet)

## So what's going to happen to Everearn?

The good news is the liquidity is still locked until [2022.07.27 15:24 UTC](https://www.pinksale.finance/#/pinklock/record/17497?chain=BSC). The bad news all of the teams projects didn't last this long.  In fact they all launched and failed within a few months of each other:

**CardanoEvo v??**: [https://evolutioncrypto.net/](https://evolutioncrypto.net/)  0xf2761e6f56fc3fba0f519e441720f80c087dba13   
**CardanoEvo v2**: [https://cardanoevo.com/](https://cardanoevo.com/)  0xc23997371bd83de427b41dabe11846c87696f40a  
**Touch Future**: [https://touchfuture.io/](https://touchfuture.io/)  0x54f11c03d93bf9a4d222363d445df7df6608ee89  
**EverEarn**: [https://everearn.net/](https://everearn.net/) 0x47d42E0e864ceFf8C4270F7b6E1f6F91Da45882C

It is likely that at some point the dev, staking or exchange wallet will start selling. And it probably gets blamed on the devs (Erico Gomes and Aaron Perras) of the team just like it happened with CardanoEvo (blamed Steve and Usema). Until then they will continue to steal the marketing tax.

The staking wallet unlocks at [2022.03.03 08:00 UTC](https://www.pinksale.finance/#/pinklock/record/17404?chain=BSC)  
The exchange wallet unlocks at [2022.03.27 09:00 UTC](https://www.pinksale.finance/#/pinklock/record/17403?chain=BSC)

## The Team behind this

The team consists of at least 2 persons with the aliases David Rahman and Trent Butler. 
The other devs on the websites/whitepaper are probably fake, since they get blamed everytime they rugpull or sell from a dev wallet, yes this happened multiple times!
